# Notes and Resources
This repository contains information of links, books to refer to along with notes I have made for the same for future reference

## Description of contents
### Git
Here's a great pdf to learn git: [progit]

[progit]:Git/progit.pdf

### Machine Learning
- [Master Machine Learning Algorithms- notes][brownlee-notes]
  Currently being updated is notes to the book, 'Master Machine Learning algorithms', by Jason Brownlee. This book gives a quickstart to developers with a need to start working with machine learning and is in no way a complete description of in-depth theory.
