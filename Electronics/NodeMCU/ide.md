## ESPlorer
ESPlorer is a very good IDE to program ESPs in Lua(which is recommended)
1. [Download][dwld-link] the zip file and extract it.

2. Then enter the directory and run `java -jar ESPlorer.jar`. Lock ESPlorer onto your launcher for convenience.

## Arduino
Using arduino programming is possible, but the uploading of code takes too long(as arduino also uploads its own firmware onto it), and it's not the way (IMO) NodeMCU was meant to be used.
This becomes a departure from the event-driven approach possible in Lua. Details may be found, if required on [ElectronicWings](https://www.electronicwings.com/nodemcu/arduino-ide).
