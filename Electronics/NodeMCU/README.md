# NodeMCU

## Syntax
- [NodeMCU Documentation](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
  <br>  A very important read is the [Lua developer FAQ][dev-faq], which stresses on the **event-driven** approach required.
- Lua Syntax - [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)

[dev-faq]:https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/lua-developer-faq

## Setup instructions
- [Setting up](./ide.md) your preferred IDE.
- [Building and Flashing](./build-flash.md) the firmware onto your device.

## Tutorials
- [ElectronicWings](http://www.electronicwings.com/nodemcu/basics)
 <br>  A good start covering the basics of using NodeMCU, with descriptions for peripherals. However, do not rely on its details only and use the official documentation for reference, with respect to firmware-building and uploading, as well as code. Certain code snippets are against the _event-driven_ approach that is required to program in when using NodeMCU.

## Tools
- [NodeMCU Build](https://nodemcu-build.com/) : A cloud-based service to build the NodeMCU Firmware.
- [NodeMCU Firmware][firmware] :The source code for building the code on your own. It is recommended to learn this from the [NodeMCU documentation][build-doc] to customize your build.
