# NodeMCU

## Syntax
- [NodeMCU Documentation](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
  <br>  A very important read is the [Lua developer FAQ][dev-faq], which stresses on the **event-driven** approach required.
- Lua Syntax - [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)

## Setup instructions
- [Setting up][ide-setup] your preferred IDE.
- [Building and Flashing][build-flash] the firmware onto your device.

## Tutorials
- [ElectronicWings](http://www.electronicwings.com/nodemcu/basics)
 <br>  A good start covering the basics of using NodeMCU, with descriptions for peripherals. However, certain code snippets are against the _event-driven_ approach that is required to program in when using NodeMCU.

## Tools
- [NodeMCU Build](https://nodemcu-build.com/) : A cloud-based service to build the NodeMCU Firmware.
- [NodeMCU Firmware][firmware] :The source code for building the code on your own. It is recommended to learn this from the [NodeMCU documentation][build-doc] to customize your build.
